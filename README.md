# FEBS_tutorial
This repository holds the course material for the tutorial at FEBS 2025.


A description (incl. some background references) is given [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SOhxdhrq_e7Ssm39LbdPNjBNFuYC-1X6aQcLMzKK9rM/edit?usp=sharing). (check different tabs for individual tutorials)

The tutorial will cover three different aspects of protien design:
1. Initial data analysis: inspecting protein language model (pLM) embedding space using [ProtSpace](https://github.com/tsenoner/ProtSpace)
2. Ranking of generated sequences: Supervised model training with [biotrainer](https://github.com/sacdallago/biotrainer)
3. Sequence generation with inverse folding using [ProstT5](https://github.com/mheinzinger/ProstT5)
